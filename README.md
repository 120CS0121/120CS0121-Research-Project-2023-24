## Missing Data Imputation in Healthcare Datasets Using Machine Learning Techniques

### MOTIVATION
In the medical world, think of missing data like pieces of a patient's health story left blank. It's like having an incomplete picture of their well-being. Now, imagine trying to make important health decisions without all the pieces - it's challenging and risky. Completing these missing parts is like filling in the gaps in a patient's health story. Why does this matter so much? Well, it's about making sure doctors have all the details they need to provide the best care. It's like making sure a puzzle is complete, so nothing important is left out. For example, if a patient has missing data in their medical history, it's like having a book with some pages torn out. You might miss important clues about their health. Imputing missing data is like fixing those torn pages, making sure the whole story is available. And it's not just about one patient. In the world of medical research and finding better treatments, having complete and accurate data is like having a clear roadmap. It helps scientists and doctors discover patterns and come up with new ways to improve health.

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This research project delves into the realm of missing data imputation in healthcare-related datasets, leveraging a novel approach known as Class Center-Based Missing Value Imputation with Normalization and Outlier Handling (CCMVI-NOH). The primary objective is to address the ubiquitous issue of missing data in healthcare datasets, aiming to provide a robust and efficient solution for estimating missing values and improving data quality.!!
###### Research Problem: 
The research addresses the critical issue of missing data in health-
care datasets, which can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of data-driven applications. The challenge is to develop a missing data imputation method that not only accurately estimates missing values but also takes into account data normalization and outlier handling, preserving the integrity of the dataset.
###### Objectives: 
The primary objectives of this research project are threefold: To develop
and evaluate the CCMVI-NOH algorithm as a comprehensive solution for missing data imputation in healthcare datasets. To optimize the imputation process using the Firefly Algorithm, incorporating the search procedure for improving accuracy, 15] To investigate the performance of the CCMVI-NOH algorithm across diverse healthcare datasets, vary- ing degrees of missingness, and missing data mechanisms.
###### Methodology: 
The research employs a multi-step approach, combining class center- based imputation with data normalization and outlier handling, supported by the Firefly Algorithm for optimization. The key steps include:
Data preprocessing, encompassing missing data filling, data scaling, and outlier han- dling. Simulated introduction of missingness into the complete dataset, creating a range of datasets with varying percentages of missing data. Application of three different impu- tation algorithms - Simple Imputer, Sampling-based decision trees, and CCMVI-NOH to the datasets. Evaluation of the imputed data using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), accuracy, and R-squared (R2) Optimization of the CCMVI-NOH algorithm using the Firefly Algorithm.
###### Expected Contributions: 
This research project is anticipated to make several notable contributions to the field of missing data imputation in healthcare datasets. These contributions include:
The introduction of CCMVI-NOH as an innovative and comprehensive imputation method, which not only estimates missing data but also addresses data normalization and outlier handling. Insights into the performance of the CCMVI-NOH algorithm across diverse healthcare datasets, providing a basis for assessing its generalizability. The devel- opment of a robust pipeline for missing data imputation, enabling the application of the CCMVI-NOH algorithm to a variety of healthcare datasets. In conclusion, this research project endeavors to offer an advanced solution to missing data imputation in healthcare datasets, potentially enhancing data quality for critical applications in healthcare, data analysis, and decision-making processes.
